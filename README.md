Helpers for compile Csharp with Roslyn.
The way use the tool installed on your machine. It does'nt work if dotnet is not installed.



Use project model for create a project file

```powershell
NuGet\Install-Package Black.Beard.Projects.Models
``` 

Use build for build project
```powershell
NuGet\Install-Package Black.Beard.Build
``` 

Use roslyn for compile without project
```powershell
NuGet\Install-Package Black.Beard.Roslyn
```
